#  Reddit Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project is a deep dive into the data of a fictional version of Reddit, the popular content rating and discussion website. We'll be looking at data from users, posts, and subreddits to gain insights and understand the behavior within this community.

### Description

Reddit is structured around users who share and rate content in thematic communities known as subreddits. This project aims to analyze user activity, post popularity, and subreddit engagement through SQL queries and data manipulation.

### Database Schema

The project is based on three main tables:

- `users`: Contains data about users.
- `posts`: Stores information on user posts.
- `subreddits`: Holds information about each subreddit.

Further details on the schema are provided within the SQL setup scripts in this repository.
